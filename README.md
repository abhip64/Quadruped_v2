# Quadruped_v2

This projects aims to develop a simulation environment capable of testing out different static gait strategies of quadruped with insect-like leg configuration.  The project has been carried out using open source platforms - **ROS** and **Gazebo**.
The project runs in concurrence with an 
 It is also meant as a detailed guide for anyone who wants to dive deep into quadrupedal locomotion strategies using statically stable gaits. Detailed documentation of the code will also be provided so that anyone can clone this repo and modify the code for their own use.
