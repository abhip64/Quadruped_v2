# Quadruped_v2

This projects aims to develop a simulation environment capable of testing out different static gait strategies of quadruped with insect-like leg configuration.  The project has been carried out using open source platforms - **ROS** and **Gazebo**.

The project runs in concurrence with an effort to develop a hardware prototype of a legged wall climbing robot. The purpose of the simulation in context with the hardware prototype is two-fold. Firstly, it should serve as an effective and efficient way to test out different leg configurations and gait strategies aiding in its design. Secondly, it should also serve as a **digital twin** for the finally design hardware of the legged walker.
For those who are interested more details on digital twins can be obtained from the link given below:


This github document is also meant as a detailed guide for anyone who wants to dive deep into quadrupedal locomotion strategies using statically stable gaits. Detailed documentation of the code will also be provided so that anyone can clone this repo and modify the code for their own use.

## Software Pre-Requisites
The project has been developed  on an Intel i5 dual core laptop running Ubuntu 16.04. The following versions of software were used

 - ROS Kinetic
 - Gazebo 9.5

> Kindly note that the code has not been tested and validated for any other versions of the above mentioned software.  Different Gazebo versions may not create problems but a different ROS

## Current Status of the Project
The project is under active development.
