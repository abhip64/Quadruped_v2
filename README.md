# Quadruped_v2

This projects aims to develop a simulation environment capable of testing out different static gait strategies of quadruped with insect-like leg configuration.  The project has been carried out using open source platforms - **ROS** and **Gazebo**.
The project runs in concurrence with an effort to develop a hardware prototype of a legged wall climbing robot. The purpose of the simulation in context with the hardware prototype is two-fold. Firstly, it should serve as an effective and efficient way to test out different leg configurations and gait strategies aiding in its design. Secondly, it should also serve as a **digita

 It is also meant as a detailed guide for anyone who wants to dive deep into quadrupedal locomotion strategies using statically stable gaits. Detailed documentation of the code will also be provided so that anyone can clone this repo and modify the code for their own use.

## Software Pre-Requisites
The project has been designed on Ubuntu 16.04 on  with the following versions of software - 

 - ROS Kinetic
 - Gazebo v9



## Current Status of the Project
The project is under active development.
