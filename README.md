This projects aims to develop a simulation environment capable of testing out different static gait strategies of quadruped with insect-like leg configuration. The project has been carried out using open source platforms - **ROS** and Gazebo. It is also meant as a detailed guide for anyone who wants to dive deep into quadrupedal locomotion strategies 

## Current Status of the Project
