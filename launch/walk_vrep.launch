  <!--In addition to the Gazebo simulator the code can also be run along with V-Rep
      simulator by using this launch file. This requires running V-Rep as a separate
      node and with each joint configured to subscribe to the joint_controller
      command being published to the Gazebo controllers. To establish connection
      between ROS and V-Rep, V-Rep-Ros-interface has to be set up. The reason for
      setting up V_Rep is because it is less resource intensive than Gazebo. Also
      it's learning curve is pretty low.-->
